Note: Technical Details

This ZRecomand App utilizes various data science techniques and processing steps to provide restaurant recommendations based on cuisine similarity. Here's an overview of the key techniques and steps involved:

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
   - The initial dataset containing restaurant information was processed to handle missing values and ensure data consistency.
   - Columns such as "Cuisines," "State," "City," and "Restaurant Name" were used for analysis and recommendation generation.

2. Similarity Calculation:
   - The similarity between restaurants was calculated using a technique called cosine similarity.
   - Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors and is commonly used for text-based similarity.

3. Restaurant Recommendations:
   - Based on the selected city and cuisine, the app identifies similar restaurants using the calculated similarity scores.
   - The top 5 restaurants with the highest similarity scores are recommended to the user.

4. Visualization:
   - The ZRecomand App incorporates various visualizations to enhance user experience and aid in data exploration.
   - A choropleth map is used to visualize the number of restaurants available per state, providing a geographical perspective.
   - A word cloud visualization showcases the most famous cuisines in the selected city, giving users a quick glimpse of popular options.

Please note that the techniques and steps mentioned above provide a high-level overview of the project. Additional details regarding data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model implementation can be provided upon request. The ZRecomand App aims to assist users in exploring restaurants and receiving personalized recommendations, enhancing their dining experiences.
